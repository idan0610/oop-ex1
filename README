=============================
In Competition class I decided to implement the tasks of one turn and one round of the game on private
methods for better readability. All public methods were implemented according the Javadoc API.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
The Smart Player first count the number of unmarked sequences exist on board at the moment. He also keep the
row, left stick and right stick numbers of the first sequence found.
Then, if the number of unmarked sequences is odd, the Smart Player marks 1 stick from the sequence found.
Otherwise, the player marks the whole first sequence found.
